DESCRIPTION "zkkodb is a lightweight, file-based, SQL-inspired relational database system implemented in C. It is designed from scratch to handle structured data with features like schema validation, referential integrity, transaction logic, and persistent storage â€“ all without relying on external database engines. The goal is to build a fully functioning database system, learning and implementing the core mechanisms manually, including indexing and parsing."
